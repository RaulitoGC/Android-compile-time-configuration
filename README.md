# Automated Resource Management for Android and iOS

Welcome to the **Automated Resource Management** repository! This project is designed to enhance your mobile development workflow by automating the pre-build configuration of resources such as `color.xml` for Android and `ColorAssets` for iOS. By utilizing Bash scripting, you can streamline resource management and improve productivity across both platforms.

## üìñ Overview
